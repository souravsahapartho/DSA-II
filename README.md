# DSA-II (C++)

Data Structure Algorithm II;
Course Code: 2218;
Trimester: Summer 2025

## 📚 Project Overview
This repository contains implementations, laboratory exercises, and assignments for the **Data Structure and Algorithms II** course. The project focuses on advanced algorithmic strategies, including Divide and Conquer, Greedy algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and Graph theory using C++.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. Lab Exercises
Practical implementations from weekly laboratory sessions:
* **Lab 01 & 02**: Fundamental C++ review, including input/output operations, frequency counting, and object-oriented concepts with Student and Employee classes.
* **Lab 03**: Recursion-based problems such as Array Sum, the "Make Sandwich" logic, and the N-th Stair problem.
* **Lab 05**: Divide and Conquer strategies, featuring Find Max-Min and the Maximum Subarray problem.
* **Lab 06**: Greedy Algorithms, including the Activity Selection Problem, Fractional Knapsack, and the Greedy Coin Change approach.
* **Lab 07**: Dynamic Programming implementations for the 0/1 Knapsack and optimal Coin Change problems.
* **Lab 08 & 09**: Advanced Graph Algorithms, including Dijkstra's Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's.

### 2. Assignments
* **Assignment 01**: A collection of advanced algorithmic problems and solutions (Files: `0112330638_1.cpp` through `0112330638_4.cpp`).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* A C++ compiler (GCC recommended).
* A standard IDE or text editor (VS Code, CodeBlocks, etc.).

### Execution
To run any of the lab or assignment files:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Compile the specific source file:
   ```bash
   g++ FileName.cpp -o FileName
